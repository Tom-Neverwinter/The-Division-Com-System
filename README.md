This Device will eventually be a complex SDR radio with the iconic Orange led ring

V1 is based around a digispark and only lights up.

V2 will use a Orangepi nano (515MB version)

Hooking up the same RGB led to it and a SDR radio. 
Hopefully I can get a armbian build up and running that supports SDR and some fun audio for bootup then proceed to scanning and actual communication over bluetooth.
